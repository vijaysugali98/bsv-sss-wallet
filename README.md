## üìñ How to Use

### Creating Backup Shares

1. **Visit the Create Page** (`/create`)
2. **Configure Your Shares**:
   - Set **K** (threshold): minimum shares needed for recovery
   - Set **N** (total): total number of shares to create
   - Choose network (mainnet/testnet)
3. **Generate or Import**:
   - Let the app generate a new random key, OR
   - Import an existing private key (WIF or hex format)
4. **Save Your Shares**:
   - Copy share strings to clipboard
   - Download as PNG images with QR codes
   - Print individual shares for offline storage
5. **Distribute Securely**: Give shares to trusted parties/locations

### Recovering Your Secret

1. **Visit the Recovery Page** (`/recover`)
2. **Configure Recovery**:
   - Set the threshold (K value from when shares were created)
   - Select the network used
3. **Input Shares**:
   - Paste share strings manually, OR
   - Scan QR codes using your device camera
   - Need at least K shares to proceed
4. **Recover**: Click "Recover Secret" to reconstruct your private key
5. **Access Info**: View the recovered Bitcoin address and public key

### Print Optimization

- **Individual Print**: Each share has a print button for optimized layout
- **QR Code Focus**: Large, high-contrast QR codes for easy scanning
- **Metadata**: Includes share index, threshold info, network, and date
- **Security Reminders**: Each printout includes storage best practices

## üîê Security Notes

### What Makes This Secure

1. **Local-Only Crypto**: All operations use browser's `window.crypto` API
2. **No Network Calls**: Secrets/shares never transmitted to any server
3. **No Server Storage**: Zero server-side persistence of sensitive data
4. **Ephemeral State**: Data cleared when you leave the application
5. **Proven Cryptography**: Uses BSV SDK's implementation of Shamir's Secret Sharing

### Security Best Practices

#### When Creating Shares:
- ‚úÖ Generate shares on a secure, offline computer if possible
- ‚úÖ Verify your browser is up-to-date and from official sources
- ‚úÖ Close other browser tabs and applications during the process
- ‚úÖ Clear browser data after use (optional but recommended)

#### When Distributing Shares:
- ‚úÖ Give different shares to different trusted parties
- ‚úÖ Store shares in different physical locations  
- ‚úÖ Use secure communication channels for digital distribution
- ‚úÖ Consider printing shares for offline storage
- ‚úÖ Never store all shares in the same location

#### When Recovering:
- ‚úÖ Only recover on a secure device
- ‚úÖ Ensure you're on the correct website (check URL)
- ‚úÖ Test recovery with a subset before relying on the backup
- ‚úÖ Create new backup shares after recovery if any shares may be compromised

### Known Limitations

- **Browser Requirement**: Requires a modern browser with Web Crypto API
- **No Mobile App**: Currently web-only (but mobile browser compatible)
- **No Hardware Wallet Integration**: Purely software-based solution
- **Single-Use Recovery**: Recovered keys exist only in browser memory

## üôã Support & FAQ

### Common Issues

**Q: The QR scanner doesn't work on my device**
A: Ensure your browser has camera permissions and you're using HTTPS (required for camera access).

**Q: Can I use this with other cryptocurrencies?**  
A: Currently optimized for Bitcoin (BSV), but the core SSS functionality works with any private key.

**Q: What happens if I lose more than N-K shares?**
A: If you lose more than the allowed number of shares, recovery becomes impossible. This is by design for security.

**Q: Is this compatible with hardware wallets?**
A: This is a software-only solution. For hardware wallet integration, you'd need to export your seed first.

### Security Questions

**Q: How do I know this is actually secure?**
A: The code is open source and auditable. All cryptography happens client-side using browser APIs. No network requests are made for sensitive operations.

**Q: What if the website goes down?**  
A: You can run this locally or on your own server. The shares themselves contain all needed information for recovery.

**Q: Should I trust this with my main wallet?**
A: Always test with small amounts first. Consider this beta software and perform your own security review.
